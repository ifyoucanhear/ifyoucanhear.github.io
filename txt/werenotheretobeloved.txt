bracing for the impact
when my eyes hit the rearview
god is in the picture again

floating through the ether
to crash down like the leaves do
we have time, but not enough to breathe

and a year goes by
just as silent as a tear
on a face you hide
keep chasing heaven

I'M BEGGING FOR THE ENDING

life escaping (serenade)
elevating in the driveway

everything will be alright
keep calm as the brakes give
(their blessing again and again)

(like your eyes do) that existence is the resource
(to remind you) how come you can't feel this anymore?

bracing for the impact (can't feel more)
when my eyes hit the rearview (what's like)
god is in the picture again (can't feel more)

lean in close
i'm not there

look at the road
we're not there

DON'T (CRASH)
DON'T (CRASH)
(DON'T)



i'm sorry for the things i can't undo (where are we?)
forgive me and the world outside your room (we're falling)

still dreaming of waking up
and now you're crawling to become
the one you've been running from (i'm not just like you)

i'm here to let you know
that it's not just up to you
STOP COUNTING THE HOURS

that you see
YOU CAN'T ADD UP
THE HOURS

(what's your problem?)
(i don't have a problem)
(then why are you here?)



"what's going on right now?"
is the sound of hell

six feet, dig it up
blame it on yourself again
reach in, let it out
we can shut it down

these are the symptoms of you
making me sick of the truth

and if you ask how
we can figure out?
why we lost ourselves?
so "let go", "calm down"

i wish it was that easy
we're all just victims of ourselves
searching our way out the shelf

these are the symptoms of you
making me sick

and it gets contagious
i've lost my patience
more desperate than before

(how, how is it)
(so they say what's on your mind)
(how, how deserving)
(it's a lie)

in the space between every "i" and "you"
you'll be safe and green 'til your lips turn blue

reset
start again
you'll starve again

THE STARS ARE BENDING TO HEAL THE PAIN
YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY, YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY

(just stop and start it) THE STARS ARE BENDING
(just stop and start it) TO HEAL THE PAIN
(just stop and start it) YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
(just stop and start it) YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY



i locked the keys inside the car
next to the infant crying in your heart
it's getting sunny
let's ditch the body in my lungs

(woo-hoo) all for one ride
(woo-hoo) your big day

(the jaws of the mirror bent)
(to blow out the candles in my head)

(now) ask yourself why
it never ends
the spine (woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
is cake (woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

the word is roaming through the dark
it's getting bloody where everybody looks for love

and her mind was born today

(trying on a hat to sever my head) today
(trying on a dress for bed)

(remind yourself to go)
(sit by yourself alone)

(wishing for a what if, what if, what if)
(and what if) you turn to dust?



you're counting
the times you've thought i've been drowning
i bet you'd like if i was failing
but thanks to you, i'm just starting

(held to keep me stay)
(left to run away)
(i'm not just one of us)
(i'm not)

you're counting
the times you've thought i've been drowning
i bet you'd like if i was failing
but thanks to you, i'm just starting

(another night in pain)
(not like the promise i made today)
we really are the same

WHAT
REMAINS? (TIME, TIME)
TIME



(then why are you here?)

you black out when
you talk too much
to keep touch with
what once was

your conscience (is too calm)
i'm not here (to be loved)
the blindfold is untied
now i don't want to be anyone

(clear your stress)

now i don't want to be anyone
anymore
anyone's
anymore



i wish i want to stay here
i wish this be enough
i wish i only love you
i wish simplicity

(look at the speed out there)
(it magnetizes me to it)
(and i have no fear)
(i'm only into this to)

(enjoy) ahh
(enjoy) ahh

i wish i'd only look
and didn't have to touch
i wish i'd only smell this
and didn't have to taste

(how can i ignore?)
(this is sex without touching)
(i'm going to explore)
(i'm only into this to)

(enjoy) ahh
(enjoy) ahh
(enjoy) ahh
(enjoy) ahh

(you will always be with me)
(you will always...)



(dumb face, new dream)
(backstairs breathing)

(your bed's empty)
(and maybe i'm crazy)
(or just)
(chasing brightness)

(downtown, we'll drown)
(flowers, showers)
(it's all a memory)
(just like me)

become a memory
become a memory
become a memory
NEXT TO ME



CAN I EXIST?
THROUGH "THIS" AND "THIS"?
NOT CALLING QUITS
AGAIN AND AGAIN

(ten years in one night)

look at the people screaming
are they dead or just believing?
nobody noticed
who's eyes were open when they died

(and i've been falling to pieces 'cause you)
(can't remember how the story goes)
(this is the sound of grieving)
your life before it's leaving

i want you to notice (to notice)
that stitch will rip before it's sewn
and i'vе been falling to pieces 'cause you (and i'vе been falling to pieces 'cause you)
rеmembered (remembered) to listen

will the pages return
your daughter to sleep?
'cause i've been dying to learn
what the end looks like for me

(you noticed)
(the pain is gone)
(you know where)
(it's coming from)

(WORDS)
(WORDS)

cheap tact
for another
cold fact
that you can't dissolve

in the warmth of a thousand lies
from those stood frozen by your side

and who's to blame when earth comes to shove
your dreams into the ceiling?
and in a flash of my trust
i turn to wasted time

there's still a passage for us
through years of days repeating
we'll reach the end
in the blink of an eye

adding up (IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE)
adding up (IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE)
adding up (IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE)
adding up (AN EYE)

(it's more than you i'm losing)
(it's more than you i'm losing)
(it's more than you i'm losing)
(the dead's adding up)
